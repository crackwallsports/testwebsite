              "兔子沒有汗腺, 所以不會流汗, 耳朵可以散熱。兔子的排尿機制屬濃縮性, 對水分的需求比其他動物來的少, 有些野兔只要靠青草上的露水即可, 或是從蔬菜攝取足夠的水分, 故很少看到兔子到河邊喝水。兔子的腸胃道內有相當多的各式菌種以維持體內腸胃消化的平衡, 野外的兔子若喝過量的生水有可能因其內部細菌破壞腸胃內的菌種平衡導致身體不適, 甚至引起死亡。但认为兔子不喝水则是误解。因食用乾式飼料與牧草的關係, 需要給予豢養的寵物兔足量乾淨的飲水, 以維持身體的必要運作功能。")

              "兔子在自然界能生存的原因來自於逃跑時能快速轉彎變換逃生方向，兔在全世界除了大洋洲以外都是原生的動物。澳洲因為以前兔子入侵，現在成了一大物種災難。")

              "有人认為兔子只喜歡吃胡蘿蔔、高麗菜，所以只需給牠這些食物；還有兔子不喝水，否則會造成肚瀉；這些都是嚴重的錯誤觀念。寵物兔的正常健康食物應是無限量牧草、適量乾糧和潔淨的飲水。")

              "Because the rabbit's epiglottis is engaged over the soft palate except when swallowing, the rabbit is an obligate nasal breather. Rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other. This way they can be distinguished from rodents, with which they are often confused.[6] Carl Linnaeus originally grouped rabbits and rodents under the class Glires; later, they were separated as the scientific consensus is that many of their similarities were a result of convergent evolution. However, recent DNA analysis and the discovery of a common ancestor has supported the view that they share a common lineage, and thus rabbits and rodents are now often referred to together as members of the superorder Glires.[7]")

              "The rabbit's long ears, which can be more than 10 cm (4 in) long, are probably an adaptation for detecting predators. They have large, powerful hind legs. The two front paws have 5 toes, the extra called the dewclaw. The hind feet have 4 toes.[8] They are plantigrade animals while at rest; however, they move around on their toes while running, assuming a more digitigrade form. Unlike some other paw structures of quadruped mammals, especially those of domesticated pets, rabbit paws lack pads.[citation needed] Their nails are strong and are used for digging; along with their teeth, they are also used for defense")

              "Rabbits are hindgut digesters. This means that most of their digestion takes place in their large intestine and cecum. In rabbits, the cecum is about 10 times bigger than the stomach and it along with the large intestine makes up roughly 40% of the rabbit's digestive tract."))
