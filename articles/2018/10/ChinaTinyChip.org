“Despite the lack of any proof that a malicious hardware chip exists, we are undertaking a complicated and time-consuming review to further address the article,” the server and storage manufacturer said in a letter to its customers, dated Oct. 18.

Super Micro denied the allegations made in the report.

The company said the design complexity makes it practically impossible to insert a functional, unauthorized component onto a motherboard without it being caught by the checks in its manufacturing and assembly process.

The stories published by Bloomberg in October 2018 had a significant impact. For Supermicro, it meant a 40% stock valuation loss. For businesses owning Supermicro hardware, this can be translated into a lot of frustration, wasted time, and resources. Considering the strong denials from Apple and Amazon, the history of inaccurate articles published by Bloomberg, including but not limited to the usage of Heartbleed by U.S. intelligence prior to the public disclosure, as well as other facts from these stories, we believe they should be taken with a grain of salt."))))
